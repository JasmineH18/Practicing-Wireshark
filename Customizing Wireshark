  This will be a guided project. Guided projects are hands on training. You follow what the teacher is doing on your software, hardware, etc. This will improve your skills on a certain subject. Below are the resources and environments I'm using.

  I will be using Wireshark on ParrotOS Hack the Box virtual machine. I mainly use Virtualbox for all my virtual machines. This project would be on customizing wireshark. Downloaded and saved Chris Greer sample trace file (https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/e6fb36096dbb) on my ParrotOS VM.

1. Setup a profile
  A profile is a set of configurations or settings. Example: Troubleshoting TCP, you can set the filters, columns, coloring for that protocol. Wireshark profile is automatically set to default. You can see which profile you are on at the bottom right.
  To create a profile, you would right click Profile: Default and click New. I'll name the profile 'Wireshark masterclass' and click OK. At the bottom right, it will show the profile I created. If I wanted to switch to a different profile, I would right click Profile: Wireshark Masterclass, and click Switch to. You can select which profile you want to switch. Below are screenshots I provided.

4. Adjust Wireshark layout
  There is many ways to adjust the layout of your Wireshark based on how you want to view your packet detail, packets bytes, etc. I'll click on Edit at the top right and click on Preferences. Then click Appearance on the right side and select Layout. I chose the second layout. You can adjust the layout of your Wireshark the way you want it, and click OK. 
  Tip: If you select the option for Packet Diagram, you can pull the values from the Packet Details to the diagram. Right the diagram > click Show Field Values. It's show all the information.

5. Add Delta Time Column and adjust Time column
  Every packet head needs to know how to read and use Delta time column. You go to Preferences and go to Appearance. Then click on the plus icon at the bottom, type Delta, and change dropdown Type to Display Time Display. Drag the Delta to put it under Time and click OK. Time column is a adjustable time column. It can be a year, month, time of day, etc. To adjust the time, you would go to View tab at the top. Go to Time Display Format and you can choose any option that best fit for you.

6. Create coloring Rule
  Coloring rules will help you pinpoint certain things you want to focus on. Example: You would go to View at the top, and click Coloring Rules. Click the plus sign on the bottom right, and type TCP SYN. type the filter to tcp.flag.syn==1. This will color the SYN and SYN ACK. Click Background at the bottom, select the color you want. I chose the light blue color. Drag the TCP SYN under the BAD TCP and click OK. If you send a SYN and it needs to be transmitted, the first SYN would be the color you chose for TCP SYN, and the second would be the BAD TCP. After clicking OK, click the refresh button.
