  This will be a guided project. Guided projects are hands on training. You follow what the teacher is doing on your software, hardware, etc. This will improve your skills on a certain subject. Below are the resources and environments I'm using.

Resources Used:
-Chris Greer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU-A2EmVrKQ&list=PLW8bTPfXNGdC5Co0VnBK1yVzAwSSphzpJ

Environments Used:
-ParrotOS HTB in Virtualbox

  I will be using Wireshark on ParrotOS Hack the Box virtual machine. I mainly use Virtualbox for all my virtual machines. This project would be on customizing wireshark. Downloaded and saved Chris Greer sample trace file (https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/e6fb36096dbb) on my ParrotOS VM.

1. Setup a profile
  A profile is a set of configurations or settings. Example: Troubleshoting TCP, you can set the filters, columns, coloring for that protocol. Wireshark profile is automatically set to default. You can see which profile you are on at the bottom right.
  To create a profile, you would right click Profile: Default and click New. I'll name the profile 'Wireshark masterclass' and click OK. At the bottom right, it will show the profile I created. If I wanted to switch to a different profile, I would right click Profile: Wireshark Masterclass, and click Switch to. You can select which profile you want to switch. Below are screenshots I provided.
