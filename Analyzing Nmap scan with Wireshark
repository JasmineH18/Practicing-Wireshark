Environments Used:
-Kali Linux in Virtualbox
-Wireshark in Kali Linux

Started Kali Linux virtual machine and opened Nmap and Wireshark. This project will be on analyzing Nmap scan with Wireshark.

TCP Connect Scan
I'll do a full open scan, but will not specify a port. By default, it'll scan the top 1000 ports or popular ports. Only scanning one network. 

In the terminal:
sudo nmap -sT 45.33.32.156 -v

I'll run the scan again with Wireshark. In Wireshark, clicked the shark fin icon to start the capture. Hovering over it with the mouse will show 'Start capturing packets'. 

The packets will start to show in Wireshark. In displayed filtered, types ip.addr == 45.33.32.156. You can see the source IP, Destination IP, port number, SYN/ACK, and other details.

Stealth Scan
I'll do a half scan without the port number and scanning one network. Wireshark will capture the packets.

In the terminal:
sudo nmap -sS 45.33.32.156 -v

Adjusted the filter to show TCP conversation. Right clicked a packet > 'Conversation Filter' > 'TCP'
You can see the source IP, Destination IP, port number, SYN/ACK, and other details. It does not complete the TCP connection
