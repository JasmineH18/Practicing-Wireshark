This will be a guided project. Guided projects are hands on training. You follow what the teacher is doing on your software, hardware, etc. This will improve your skills on a certain subject. Below are the resources and environments I'm using.

Resources Used:
-Chris Greer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU-A2EmVrKQ&list=PLW8bTPfXNGdC5Co0VnBK1yVzAwSSphzpJ

Environments Used:
-ParrotOS HTB in Virtualbox

  I will be using Wireshark on ParrotOS Hack the Box virtual machine from VirtualBox. This project would be on name resolution in Wireshark. Downloaded and saved Chris Greer sample trace file (https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/e6fb36096dbb) on my ParrotOS VM.

With name resolution you can name the numbers on the packets. It can be IP addresses, TCP port values, etc. 

1. Resolving MAC and TCP ports
In Wireshark: Go to 'Edit' > 'Preferences' > 'Name Resolution' 

Resolve MAC addresses: Layer 2 MAC address resolution that will give organization unique identifier a name. If unchecked, it'll only show the MAC addresses in hexadecimal. I unchecked it and clicked 'OK'. Selected a packet from the Packet List. In Packet Details, clicked the dropdown on 'Ethernet II' and it'll only show the MAC addresses.

Resolve transport names: If unchecked, it'll show the TCP port numbers, and the client-side ephemeral large number. If checked, it'll show port values with the well known port numbers. Example: http(443)
