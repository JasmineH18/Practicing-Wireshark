This will be a guided project. Guided projects are hands on training. You follow what the teacher is doing on your software, hardware, etc. This will improve your skills on a certain subject. Below are the resources and environments I'm using.

Environments Used:
-ParrotOS HTB in Virtualbox

  I will be using Wireshark on ParrotOS Hack the Box virtual machine from VirtualBox. This project would be on how to read pcaps with Wireshark statistics. Downloaded and saved Chris Greer sample trace file (https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/1c710c0fc15e) on my ParrotOS VM.

On Wireshark: clicked File > Open > selected the folder the file saved on, clicked Open. https://imgur.com/zoS5Win

From Wireshark document
"Wireshark provides a wide range of network statistics which can be accessed via the Statistics menu."

"These statistics range from general information about the loaded capture file (like the number of captured packets), to statistics about specific protocols (e.g., statistics about the number of HTTP requests and responses captured)."

General statistics

Capture File Properties about the capture file.
Protocol Hierarchy of the captured packets.
Conversations e.g., traffic between specific IP addresses.
Endpoints e.g., traffic to and from IP addresses.
I/O Graphs visualizing the number of packets (or similar) in time.

Protocol specific statistics

Service Response Time between request and response of some protocols.
Various other protocol specific statistics.


Go to 'Statistics' tab > 'Conversations'. Conversation will show me by layer of address how many conversations I have in this trace file. You can see the conversations between Address A and Address B. Especially see the Packets and Bytes. There's two columns called 'Rel Start (Relative start)' and 'Duration'. The grey bar means how long the conversation and where in the trace file did it start.

Rel Start and Duration: Ex. Rel Start 4.602537, Duration 7.6345. The grey bar for Rel Start show is on 4.602. Which means the conversation took 4.6 seconds into the trace file and it lasted for 7.6 seconds.

In the IPv4 tab, you'll notice 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.2, 192.168.0.3, 192.168.0.4, 192.168.0.5, and so on.
