This will be a guided project. Guided projects are hands on training. You follow what the teacher is doing on your software, hardware, etc. This will improve your skills on a certain subject. Below are the resources and environments I'm using.

Environments Used:
-ParrotOS HTB in Virtualbox

  I will be using Wireshark on ParrotOS Hack the Box virtual machine from VirtualBox. This project would be on how to read pcaps with Wireshark statistics. Downloaded and saved Chris Greer sample trace file (https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/1c710c0fc15e) on my ParrotOS VM.

On Wireshark: clicked File > Open > selected the folder the file saved on, clicked Open. https://imgur.com/zoS5Win

From Wireshark document
"Wireshark provides a wide range of network statistics which can be accessed via the Statistics menu."

"These statistics range from general information about the loaded capture file (like the number of captured packets), to statistics about specific protocols (e.g., statistics about the number of HTTP requests and responses captured)."

General statistics

Capture File Properties about the capture file.
Protocol Hierarchy of the captured packets.
Conversations e.g., traffic between specific IP addresses.
Endpoints e.g., traffic to and from IP addresses.
I/O Graphs visualizing the number of packets (or similar) in time.

Protocol specific statistics

Service Response Time between request and response of some protocols.
Various other protocol specific statistics.


Go to 'Statistics' tab > 'Conversations'. Conversation will show me by layer of address how many conversations I have in this trace file. You can see the conversations between Address A and Address B. Especially see the Packets and Bytes. There's two columns called 'Rel Start (Relative start)' and 'Duration'. The grey bar means how long the conversation and where in the trace file did it start.

Rel Start and Duration: Ex. Rel Start 4.602537, Duration 7.6345. The grey bar for Rel Start show is on 4.602. Which means the conversation took 4.6 seconds into the trace file and it lasted for 7.6 seconds.

In the IPv4 tab, you'll notice 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.2, 192.168.0.3, 192.168.0.4, 192.168.0.5, and so on. It's scanning a lot of IP's and something may be happening in the entire subnet.

Switched to 'TCP' tab. There are 17,476 conversations. Some packets show low number of packets. By looking at the ports, it's behaving like a port scan. like it's one machine going through port 443 and the entire subnet trying to see if anybody is listening to that port. Sorted the port by clicking 'Port B'. You can see the scanner 2.15 is going out to and it's hitting port 1, 3, 7, and so on. It's not sequential and the port numbers goes up ending in port 999. It looks like it's trying to avoid detection. Seeing a very port number to start with and trying to initiate another device would look suspicious.

If you wanted to track down a slow file transfer or a large data set, you can sort the 'Bytes' by clicking on it. You'll be able to see the size, who's talking to who, and which conversation to analyze. Right clicked a byte > 'Apply as Filter' > A <> B > Close the Statistics Conversation popup. It'll show bi-directional traffic between the two stations and is filtered between those two endpoints. You can see the protocol used. If you want to do the TCP, MAC, IP etc, you would follow the same steps as the bytes.

By using Wireshark Statistics, you can see some unusual activity. It's used in network forensics, find if someone enumerating different devices, and finding intrusions, etc. You would have to find out who 2.15 is and why they are scanning the entire subnet looking for these open ports.
