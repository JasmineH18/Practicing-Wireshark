This will be a guided project. Guided projects are hands on training. You follow what the teacher is doing on your software, hardware, etc. This will improve your skills on a certain subject. Below are the resources and environments I'm using.

Environments Used:
-ParrotOS HTB in Virtualbox

   I will be using Wireshark on ParrotOS Hack the Box virtual machine from VirtualBox. This project will focus on capturing packets with dumpcap and tcpdump in the Command Line.

Capture packets with dumpcap

You can install windows 10 installation media on VMWare, Virtualbox, etc. Windows 10 link (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and how to, video starts 4:50 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kku0fVfksrk). After the virtual machine setup, you would download Wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org/download.html). Export and save Chris Greer sample trace file (https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/e6fb36096dbb).

In Windows, you would need to access Command prompt from the Start menu. Make sure to have the Wireshark directory path.

Add the Wireshark directory path:
1. In the Command prompt, go to the root folder. Type 'cd /' > 'cd program files' > and then cd wireshark.
2. Type 'dir' and you should see the command line tools. Scroll down and you'll see the path. C:\Program Files\Wireshark>. You can type 'Path'.
3. To save the path, Go to control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables > Click 'Edit' and 'New' > Click 'Browse' and find the Wireshark directory > Click OK

In the Command Prompt/Terminal in the Wireshark path, type 'dumpcap -h'. You should see all the option you can do with dumpcap. -i will tell the system which interface you want to capture from. Type 'dumpcap -D' to see your list of interfaces on your system, and it shows the index number for it. Example: Type dumpcap -i 1. I chose the first interface with the index '1'. Hit 'Enter' and you should see it start capturing that interface. Press 'CTRL + C' to stop the capture. You can tell dumpcap where to save the data. It's best not to save it in the TMP folder as it stores data temporarily. Type 'dumpcap -i 1 -w <file name location of your choice>' and press enter. It will continue to capture to that file until you stop it with 'CTRL + C'. You can view it on GUI to see that file you saved to. You can break the capture packets into smaller pieces using a ring buffer. Type 'dumpcap -i 1 -w <file name location> -b filesize:500000 -b files:10'. The file size would be 500 megabyte pcap and save 10 500 megabyte for the amount in the ring buffer.           


Capture packets with tcpdump 

I'll be using ParrotOS HTB to capture packets with tcpdump. Opened two terminals. One terminal will show the tcpdump manuel, and the second terminal to capture the packets. Typed 'man tcpdump', hit Enter and it should show the manuel. Typed 'tcpdump -D' to see the list of interfaces. Type 'tcpdump -i 1' or 'sudo tcpdump -i 1' to start capturing the packets. Hit CTRL + C to stop the cpature. To save the data, Type 'tcpdump -i 1 -w <file name  or location of your choice> -B 10' and press enter. Mine will be tcpdump -i 1 -w sample.pcapng -B 10. Using the -B for Buffer size will put the data in smaller pieces in the sample.pcapng. It makes it easier to check specific data when troubleshooting.
