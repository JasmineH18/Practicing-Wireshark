This will be a guided project. Guided projects are hands on training. You follow what the teacher is doing on your software, hardware, etc. This will improve your skills on a certain subject. Below are the resources and environments I'm using.  

Resources Used:
-Chris Greer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAtyzE1TUlI&list=PLW8bTPfXNGdC5Co0VnBK1yVzAwSSphzpJ&index=3

Environments Used:
-ParrotOS HTB in Virtualbox

   I will be using Wireshark on ParrotOS Hack the Box virtual machine. I mainly use Virtualbox for all my virtual machines. This project will focus on capturing packets with dumpcap and tcpdump in the Command Line.

Capture packets with dumpcap

You can install windows 10 installation media on VMWare, Virtualbox, etc. Windows 10 link (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and how to, video starts 4:50 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kku0fVfksrk). After the virtual machine setup, you would download Wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org/download.html). Export and save Chris Greer sample trace file (https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/e6fb36096dbb).

In Windows, you would need to access Command prompt from the Start menu. Make sure to have the Wireshark directory path.

Add the Wireshark directory path:
1. In the Command prompt, go to the root folder. Type 'cd /' > 'cd program files' > and then cd wireshark.
2. Type 'dir' and you should see the command line tools. Scroll down and you'll see the path. C:\Program Files\Wireshark>. You can type 'Path'.
3. To save the path, Go to control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables > Click 'Edit' and 'New' > Click 'Browse' and find the Wireshark directory > Click OK

In the Command Prompt/Terminal in the Wireshark path, type 'dumpcap -h'. You should see all the option you can do with dumpcap. -i will tell the system which interface you want to capture from.
