This will be a guided project. Guided projects are hands on training. You follow what the teacher is doing on your software, hardware, etc. This will improve your skills on a certain subject. Below are the resources and environments I'm using.

I will be using Wireshark on Kali Linux virtual machine from VirtualBox, as ParrotOS HTB seems to be freezing badly. This project would be on how to map IP address locations with Wireshark using GeoIP. Downloaded and saved Chris Greer sample trace file (https://www.cloudshark.org/captures/a9472fbe700a) on my ParrotOS VM.
